The problem of distinguishing prime numbers from composite numbers and of
resolving the latter into their prime factors is known to be one of the most
important and useful in arithmetic
The prime factors of 1231952 are 2, 2, 2, 2, 37 and 2081.
Write a program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number
612852475143, followed by a new line.
```
* You are allowed to use the standard library
* Your program will be compiled with this command: gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -
* Wextra 100-prime_factor.c -o 100-prime_factor -lm

Numbers have life; they're not just symbols on paper
Write a function that prints an integer.
```
* Prototype: void print_number(int n);
* You can only use _putchar function to print
* You are not allowed to use long
* You are not allowed to use arrays or pointers
* You are not allowed to hard-code special values
